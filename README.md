# Getting Started

I recommend starting with this [tutorial](https://www.gdquest.com/tutorial/godot/2d/first-2d-game-godot-4/)

The detailed setup and usage instructions will be provided upon the project's completion.

# Contributing

At this time, direct contributions to the project are not supported. However, if you are interested in collaborating or offering assistance, please feel free to reach out to me personally via email (look on profile) or connect with me on LinkedIn. I'm open to cooperation and would love to discuss potential opportunities.
